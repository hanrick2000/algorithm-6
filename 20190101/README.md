https://www.lintcode.com/problem/valid-palindrome-ii

### Description
Given a non-empty string s, you may delete at most one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.

The string will only contain lowercase characters a-z. The maximum length of the string is 50000.

https://www.lintcode.com/problem/find-median-from-data-stream

### Description
Numbers keep coming, return the median of numbers at every time a new number added.

### Clarification
What's the definition of Median?

Median is the number that in the middle of a sorted array. If there are n numbers in a sorted array A, the median is A[(n - 1) / 2]. For example, if A=[1,2,3], median is 2. If A=[1,19], median is 1.

### Example
For numbers coming list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], return [1, 1, 2, 2, 3].

For numbers coming list: [4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6, 0], return [4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3].

For numbers coming list: [2, 20, 100], return [2, 2, 20].

### Challenge
Total run time in O(nlogn).
