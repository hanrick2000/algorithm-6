# 7 - Permutation-based & Graph-based DFS

## Required

### Medium  425. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

#### Description
Given a digit string excluded 01, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below.

Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.

#### Example
    Given "23"

    Return
    ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]

### Medium  10. String Permutation II
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/string-permutation-ii

#### Description
Given a string, find all permutations of it without duplicates.

#### Example
Given "abb", return ["abb", "bab", "bba"].

Given "aabb", return ["aabb", "abab", "baba", "bbaa", "abba", "baab"].

### Medium  34. N-Queens II
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/n-queens-ii

#### Description
Follow up for N-Queens problem.

Now, instead outputting board configurations, return the total number of distinct solutions.

#### Example
For n=4, there are 2 distinct solutions.

### Medium  33. N-Queens
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/n-queens

#### Description
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

#### Example
There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:

    [
      // Solution 1
      [".Q..",
       "...Q",
       "Q...",
       "..Q."
      ],
      // Solution 2
      ["..Q.",
       "Q...",
       "...Q",
       ".Q.."
      ]
    ]

#### Challenge
Can you do it without recursion?

### Medium  16. Permutations II
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/permutations-ii

#### Description
Given a list of numbers with duplicate number in it. Find all unique permutations.

#### Example
For numbers [1,2,2] the unique permutations are:

    [
      [1,2,2],
      [2,1,2],
      [2,2,1]
    ]

#### Challenge
Using recursion to do it is acceptable. If you can do it without recursion, that would be great!

### Medium  15. Permutations
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/permutations

#### Description
Given a list of numbers, return all possible permutations.

You can assume that there is no duplicate numbers in the list.

#### Example
For nums = [1,2,3], the permutations are:

    [
      [1,2,3],
      [1,3,2],
      [2,1,3],
      [2,3,1],
      [3,1,2],
      [3,2,1]
    ]

#### Challenge
Do it without recursion.

### Hard  829. Word Pattern II
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/word-pattern-ii

#### Description
Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.(i.e if a corresponds to s, then b cannot correspond to s. For example, given pattern = "ab", str = "ss", return false.)

You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.

#### Example
Given pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue", return true.
Given pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd", return true.
Given pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc", return false.

### Hard  132. Word Search II
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/word-search-ii

#### Description
Given a matrix of lower alphabets and a dictionary. Find all words in the dictionary that can be found in the matrix. A word can start from any position in the matrix and go left/right/up/down to the adjacent position. One character only be used once in one word. No same word in dictionary

#### Example
Given matrix:
    doaf
    agai
    dcan
and dictionary:

    {"dog", "dad", "dgdg", "can", "again"}

    return {"dog", "dad", "can", "again"}

    dog:
    doaf
    agai
    dcan
    dad:

    doaf
    agai
    dcan
    can:

    doaf
    agai
    dcan
    again:

    doaf
    agai
    dcan

#### Challenge
Using trie to implement your algorithm.

### Hard  121. Word Ladder II
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/word-ladder-ii

#### Description
Given two words (start and end), and a dictionary, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from start to end, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time
Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.

#### Example
Given:
    start = "hit"
    end = "cog"
    dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Return
    [
      ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
      ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
    ]
