## 52. Next Permutation
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/next-permutation

### Description
Given a list of integers, which denote a permutation.

Find the next permutation in ascending order.

The list may contains duplicate integers.

### Example
For [1,3,2,3], the next permutation is [1,3,3,2]

For [4,3,2,1], the next permutation is [1,2,3,4]


## 190. Next Permutation II
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/next-permutation-ii

### Description
Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

### Example
Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

1,2,3 → 1,3,2

3,2,1 → 1,2,3

1,1,5 → 1,5,1

### Challenge
The replacement must be in-place, do not allocate extra memory.


## 15. Permutations
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/permutations

### Description
Given a list of numbers, return all possible permutations.

You can assume that there is no duplicate numbers in the list.

### Example
For nums = [1,2,3], the permutations are:

    [
      [1,2,3],
      [1,3,2],
      [2,1,3],
      [2,3,1],
      [3,1,2],
      [3,2,1]
    ]

### Challenge
Do it without recursion.


## 16. Permutations II
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/permutations-ii

### Description
Given a list of numbers with duplicate number in it. Find all unique permutations.

### Example
For numbers [1,2,2] the unique permutations are:

    [
      [1,2,2],
      [2,1,2],
      [2,2,1]
    ]

### Challenge
Using recursion to do it is acceptable. If you can do it without recursion, that would be great!
