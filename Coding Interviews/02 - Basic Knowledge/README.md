### Naive 366. Fibonacci
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/fibonacci
https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/

#### Description

Find the Nth number in Fibonacci sequence.

A Fibonacci sequence is defined as follow:

    * The first two numbers are 0 and 1.
    * The i th number is the sum of i-1 th number and i-2 th number.
The first ten numbers in Fibonacci sequence is:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...

    The Nth fibonacci number won't exceed the max value of signed 32-bit integer in the test cases.

#### Example
##### Example 1:
  	Input:  1
  	Output: 0

  	Explanation:
  	return the first number in  Fibonacci sequence .

##### Example 2:
  	Input:  2
  	Output: 1

  	Explanation:
  	return the second number in  Fibonacci sequence .


### Easy  204. Singleton
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/singleton/

#### Description

Singleton is a most widely used design pattern. If a class has and only has one instance at every moment, we call this design as singleton. For example, for class Mouse (not a animal mouse), we should design it in singleton.

You job is to implement a getInstance method for given class, return the same instance of this class every time you call this method.

#### Example

    In Java:

    	A a = A.getInstance();
    	A b = A.getInstance();

    a should equal to b.

#### Challenge
If we call getInstance concurrently, can you make sure your code could run correctly?


### Easy 212. Space Replacement
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/space-replacement/

#### Description

Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with %20. The string is given in a characters array, you can assume it has enough space for replacement and you are given the true length of the string.

You code should also return the new length of the string after replacement.

If you are using Java or Pythonï¼Œplease use characters array instead of string.

#### Example
##### Example 1:

    Input: string[] = "Mr John Smith" and length = 13
    Output: string[] = "Mr%20John%20Smith" and return 17
    Explanation:
    The string after replacement should be "Mr%20John%20Smith", you need to change the string in-place and return the new length 17.
##### Example 2:

    Input: string[] = "LintCode and Jiuzhang" and length = 21
    Output: string[] = "LintCode%20and%20Jiuzhang" and return 25
    Explanation:
    The string after replacement should be "LintCode%20and%20Jiuzhang", you need to change the string in-place and return the new length 25.

####Challenge
Do it in-place.


### Easy 365. Count 1 in Binary
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/count-1-in-binary/

#### Description

Count how many 1 in binary representation of a 32-bit integer.

#### Example
##### Example 1:

    Input: 32
    Output: 1
    Explanation:
    32(100000), return 1.
##### Example 2:

    Input: 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
    5(101), return 2.

#### Challenge
If the integer is n bits with m 1 bits. Can you do it in O(m) time?


### Easy 35. Reverse Linked List
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/reverse-linked-list/
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

#### Description

Reverse a linked list.

#### Example
##### Example 1:

    Input: 1->2->3->null
    Output: 3->2->1->null
##### Example 2:

    Input: 1->2->3->4->null
    Output: 4->3->2->1->null

#### Challenge
Reverse it in-place and in one-pass
