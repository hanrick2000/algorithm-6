https://www.lintcode.com/problem/count-1-in-binary

### Description
Count how many 1 in binary representation of a 32-bit integer.

### Example
Given 32, return 1

Given 5, return 2

Given 1023, return 9

### Challenge
If the integer is n bits with m 1 bits. Can you do it in O(m) time?

https://www.lintcode.com/problem/merge-k-sorted-arrays

### Description
Given k sorted integer arrays, merge them into one sorted array.

### Example
Given 3 sorted arrays:

    [
      [1, 3, 5, 7],
      [2, 4, 6],
      [0, 8, 9, 10, 11]
    ]
return [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

### Challenge
Do it in O(N log k).

N is the total number of integers.
k is the number of arrays.
